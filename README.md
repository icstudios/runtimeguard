# RuntimeGuard
An environment validator for Node.js applications - serving as a "pre-loader" of sorts - to ensure that environment variables are configured, dependencies are installed, and utility versions are satisfied. 

RuntimeGuard is a faithful fork of Eos, a runtime pre-loader created by [Dannington](https://github.com/Dannnington) for application dependency compliance.
